#Matt Biggers

My name is Matt Biggers and I've lived in Seattle since 2010.  I am originally from Texas and have lived in five different countries including the States.  I got married this year to Ashley who I met in Seattle in October 2010.  We got married on a beach in Nicaragua this past February.

##Work and Play

By day, I work in a large tech company doing technical and financial analysis and project management.  I'm learing Python in order to make a career change and the flexibility of being able to telecommute from anywhere in the world.

By night, I enjoy good TV shows, video games, scifi books, and hanging out with  my wife.  On the weekends, it's difficult to pry the beer or margarita from my hand.  If you're looking for the best margarita in town, head to [The Saint](http://www.thesaintsocialclub.com/) in Capitol Hill.  The food is average, but the drinks are truly special.
